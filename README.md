# WGamemode 2

This is a plugin for the Spigot MC server (1.8+) that allows server admins to set 
automatic gamemode rules for WorldGuard regions.

This is a rewritten implementation of the 
[WGamemode plugin](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/wgamemode/) originally 
written by Sinnoh, who appears to have left the MC scene in 2012.
